        <h2>Doctrine of Dixieland</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>On the Nature of Nations</h3>
            <p>A nation is not an idea. It is a people. It is forged by faith, kinship, and soil. True nations grow from families and communities, not from abstractions or contracts. They arise organically, bound together by language, custom, and memory. Without these, there is no nation, only a marketplace of strangers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>On the Founding of Dixieland</h3>
            <p>Dixieland was planted by men who carried the spirit of Christendom and the honor of their forefathers across the sea. It was founded not as an experiment but as an inheritance. Though humbled by war and occupation, Dixieland has endured. Her faith, though assaulted, has not perished. Her households, though battered, still remember. She was and remains a nation by birthright, not by permission.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>On Order and Nobility</h3>
            <p>Equality is not order. Dixieland affirms that true freedom and peace arise from hierarchy, duty, and station. Nobility is not tyranny, but responsibility. The strong are called to serve, the wise to guide, and the faithful to persevere. Our society shall be one of households, not of isolated consumers; of oaths, not of contracts; of heritage, not of ideology.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>On the Confederation</h3>
            <p>Dixieland does not stand alone. She is but one of the Twelve Nations of America. Each must tend to its own, according to its own customs. Yet, in matters of common defense, trade, and covenantal obligation, the Twelve may unite as brethren. Such unity must not devour distinctness but protect it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>On the Path Forward</h3>
            <p>We reject the false gospel of consumerism and universalism. We will not look to Washington for our renewal. We will build parallel institutions. We will raise households, not merely individuals. We will restore the covenant among our people and with our God. Let Dixieland be the first among the Twelve to remember, to rise, and to stand.</p>
