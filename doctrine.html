        <h2>The Doctrine of Dixieland</h2>

        <!-- Preface -->
        <section>
          <h3>Preface</h3>
          <blockquote>"Where there is no vision, the people perish."<br>â€” Proverbs 29:18</blockquote>

          <p>A people without doctrine is a people without a foundation. Without it, they wander, forget who they are, and soon fall into ruin. Doctrine is not just words on a page. It is the living memory of a people, passed from one generation to the next. It teaches us who we are, what we must do, and what we hope to become.</p>

          <p>But more than this, doctrine gives us unity of mind and clarity of speech. It is through shared understanding that we may speak with one voice, labor side by side, and build without confusion. Without doctrine, there is no common tongue; with it, the scattered stones may be gathered and set into lasting walls.</p>

          <p>This doctrine is given so that every man, woman, and child may come to know the truth of our life as Christians, as Southerners, and as one of the Twelve Nations. It is our covenant, our confession, and the path we walk together.</p>

          <p>Everyone must know this teaching. When we know it, we can speak clearly to our kin, stand firm before strangers, and labor with purpose to restore what has been broken.</p>
