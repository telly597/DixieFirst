        <h2>The Doctrine of Dixieland</h2>

        <!-- Preface -->

          <h3>Preface</h3>
          <blockquote>"Where there is no vision, the people perish."<br>— Proverbs 29:18</blockquote>

          <p>A people without doctrine is a people without a foundation. Without it, they wander, forget who they are, and soon fall into ruin. Doctrine is not just words on a page. It is the living memory of a people, passed from one generation to the next. It teaches us who we are, what we must do, and what we hope to become.</p>

          <p>But more than this, doctrine gives us unity of mind and clarity of speech. It is through shared understanding that we may speak with one voice, labor side by side, and build without confusion. Without doctrine, there is no common tongue; with it, the scattered stones may be gathered and set into lasting walls.</p>

          <p>This doctrine is given so that every man, woman, and child may come to know the truth of our life as Christians, as Southerners, and as one of the Twelve Nations. It is our covenant, our confession, and the path we walk together.</p>

          <p>Everyone must know this teaching. When we know it, we can speak clearly to our kin, stand firm before strangers, and labor with purpose to restore what has been broken.</p>

          <h3>Ecclesial Section — The Christian Foundation of Dixieland</h3>

          <h4>On the Revelation of Christ</h4>
          <p>Dixieland is a nation founded on the revelation of Jesus Christ, who is the Lord of Heaven and the Ruler of all things. He is not only the Savior of men but the King whose reign reaches from the highest heavens to the common fields and quiet towns of the South. From Him comes all order. His Word gives shape to both the soul and the nation.</p>

          <p>There is no division between the heavenly reality and the world around us. Heaven stands behind and within all that we see. From the throne of Christ flows the pattern by which all things are rightly ordered. Our households, our clans, our councils, and our customs are not inventions of men, but reflections of the greater order above. From Christ, the Heavenly King, every station and duty is set, from the elder who guides to the common man who tends his home and works his land.</p>

          <p>Without Christ, there is no Dixieland. Without Him, there is no true people. He is both the bond and the measure of our life together.</p>

          <h4>On the Threefold Witness</h4>
          <p>The faith of our people has been handed down through three great streams: Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. Though different in customs and rites, each carries within it the inheritance of the ancient Church and bears witness to the truth of Christ. We do not erase these differences, but we recognize that God has not abandoned any of them.</p>

          <p>Each man of Dixieland is free to worship according to his conscience and the tradition handed to him, so long as he confesses Christ as Lord and holds fast to the Christian faith. Among us, there is no room for rivalry between churches. The tribe stands as one people, not by uniformity of practice, but by unity of faith.</p>

          <h4>On the Primacy of the Spirit</h4>
          <p>A people is not held together by blood alone, nor by wealth, nor by the plans of men. Without the Spirit of God, a nation becomes a crowd without purpose. What gives life to Dixieland is not the memory of past battles or old songs alone, but the presence of Christ in the hearts of its people.</p>

          <p>The soul comes before every earthly concern. Blood, soil, and custom are good, but they are not the highest good. The tribe will always place the life of the spirit above wealth, politics, and even kinship. A stranger who knows Christ is closer to us than a brother who has forgotten Him.</p>

          <h4>On Christian Life within the Tribe</h4>
          <p>The households and clans of Dixieland shall live according to the faith, not only in word but in practice. Let prayers be said in the home. Let the holy days be honored. Let the sacraments be received with reverence. The life of the tribe is not just for gathering and working, but for worship and thanksgiving.</p>

          <p>The elders and councils are to keep the tribe in right order, so that its customs and decisions reflect the truth of Christ. All who confess Him are to be treated as brothers, whether Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant. Though we may worship differently, we are bound by the same Lord and the same hope.</p>
