            <h3>Preface</h3>
            <blockquote>"Where there is no vision, the people perish."<br>— Proverbs 29:18</blockquote>

            <p>A people without doctrine is a people without a foundation. Without it, they wander, forget who they are, and soon fall into ruin. Doctrine is not just words on a page. It is the living memory of a people, passed from one generation to the next. It teaches us who we are, what we must do, and what we hope to become.</p>

            <p>But more than this, doctrine gives us unity of mind and clarity of speech. It is through shared understanding that we may speak with one voice, labor side by side, and build without confusion. Without doctrine, there is no common tongue; with it, the scattered stones may be gathered and set into lasting walls.</p>

            <p>This doctrine is given so that every man, woman, and child may come to know the truth of our life as Christians, as Southerners, and as one of the Twelve Nations. It is our covenant, our confession, and the path we walk together.</p>

            <p>Everyone must know this teaching. When we know it, we can speak clearly to our kin, stand firm before strangers, and labor with purpose to restore what has been broken.</p>

            <h3>Ecclesial Section — The Christian Foundation of Dixieland</h3>

            <h4>On the Revelation of Christ</h4>
            <p>Dixieland is a nation founded on the revelation of Jesus Christ, who is the Lord of Heaven and the Ruler of all things. He is not only the Savior of men but the King whose reign reaches from the highest heavens to the common fields and quiet towns of the South. From Him comes all order. His Word gives shape to both the soul and the nation.</p>

            <p>There is no division between the heavenly reality and the world around us. Heaven stands behind and within all that we see. From the throne of Christ flows the pattern by which all things are rightly ordered. Our households, our clans, our councils, and our customs are not inventions of men, but reflections of the greater order above. From Christ, the Heavenly King, every station and duty is set, from the elder who guides to the common man who tends his home and works his land.</p>

            <p>Without Christ, there is no Dixieland. Without Him, there is no true people. He is both the bond and the measure of our life together.</p>

            <h4>On the Threefold Witness</h4>
            <p>The faith of our people has been handed down through three great streams: Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. Though different in customs and rites, each carries within it the inheritance of the ancient Church and bears witness to the truth of Christ. We do not erase these differences, but we recognize that God has not abandoned any of them.</p>

            <p>Each man of Dixieland is free to worship according to his conscience and the tradition handed to him, so long as he confesses Christ as Lord and holds fast to the Christian faith. Among us, there is no room for rivalry between churches. The tribe stands as one people, not by uniformity of practice, but by unity of faith.</p>

            <h4>On the Primacy of the Spirit</h4>
            <p>A people is not held together by blood alone, nor by wealth, nor by the plans of men. Without the Spirit of God, a nation becomes a crowd without purpose. What gives life to Dixieland is not the memory of past battles or old songs alone, but the presence of Christ in the hearts of its people.</p>

            <p>The soul comes before every earthly concern. Blood, soil, and custom are good, but they are not the highest good. The tribe will always place the life of the spirit above wealth, politics, and even kinship. A stranger who knows Christ is closer to us than a brother who has forgotten Him.</p>

            <h4>On Christian Life within the Tribe</h4>
            <p>The households and clans of Dixieland shall live according to the faith, not only in word but in practice. Let prayers be said in the home. Let the holy days be honored. Let the sacraments be received with reverence. The life of the tribe is not just for gathering and working, but for worship and thanksgiving.</p>

            <p>The elders and councils are to keep the tribe in right order, so that its customs and decisions reflect the truth of Christ. All who confess Him are to be treated as brothers, whether Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant. Though we may worship differently, we are bound by the same Lord and the same hope.</p>

                <!-- Ethnic Section -->
                <section class="doctrine-section">
                  <h3>Ethnic Section — The People of Dixieland</h3>

                  <h4>On the Pattern of the Ancients</h4>
                  <p>This bond of blood and land is not new, nor peculiar to us alone. From the earliest times, God has ordered the nations according to this very pattern. The tribes of Israel were not gathered by mere agreement, but by the blood of their fathers. Each tribe was given its portion, its borders, its elders, and its laws. They were bound together by descent, covenant, and the land set apart for them by God. In the same way, Dixieland is not the work of men’s invention, but the fruit of blood, soil, and faith bound together under Heaven. We walk in the pattern God has always given to the nations, and we shall not depart from it.</p>

                  <h4>On the Providence of Blood</h4>
                  <p>The people of Dixieland are not gathered by chance, nor by the cleverness of men, but by the will of God. It is God alone who set the bounds of nations and marked out the inheritance of peoples. He who made the sun and the stars also gave to us our blood and placed us upon this land. To belong to Dixieland is not only to speak a common tongue or follow old customs, but to share in the very lineage ordained by Heaven.</p>

                  <p>The body we bear is no accident. It is like a uniform, given to us by God, to mark us out as a people distinct and set apart. We give thanks that God, in His wisdom, made us as we are and placed us where we belong. It is no small thing to be given the duty to bear this mark, for the world often despises it. Yet we are called to stand firm and affirm God’s creation without apology.</p>

                  <h4>On Blood and Soil</h4>
                  <p>The bond between the Southern people and the land is not a matter of convenience. It is sacred. The hills, rivers, fields, and forests of Dixieland have been marked by the labors, prayers, and blood of our forefathers. This land is not simply where we live, it is part of who we are. The soil remembers. The land and the people were joined together from the beginning, and no man has the right to sever what God has joined.</p>

                  <p>To be Southern is to belong to this land by birth, by blood, and by covenant. The fields bear the memory of the dead, the woods carry the songs of the living, and the rivers tell the story of the people who have walked its banks. This is our inheritance, and it must be kept.</p>

                  <h4>On the Laws of Preservation</h4>
                  <p>Our fathers knew well the need to guard the blood of the tribe. It was not hatred that moved them, but reverence. They saw clearly what many today have forgotten, that a people who forgets its own kind, or mingles without order, becomes weak and broken. Laws were once made in the South to protect this inheritance, and such wisdom ought never to be mocked nor forgotten.</p>

                  <p>The people of Dixieland bear the responsibility to preserve the bond of blood and land given to them. This is not a task of arrogance, but of obedience. We are stewards of what we have received. To neglect it would be to rebel against the order of Heaven itself.</p>

                  <h4>On Duty and Gratitude</h4>
                  <p>We who live today have inherited both a blessing and a burden. It is a blessing to wear the mark of Dixieland, to bear the blood of those who came before, and to stand upon the soil they won and kept. Yet it is also a burden, for we must guard what they have passed down to us. We must teach our children, honor our kin, and bind ourselves together in loyalty.</p>

                  <p>No one is born into Dixieland by accident. God Himself has seen fit to place us here, to give us this blood, and to charge us with its preservation. We accept this charge gladly, and we will not abandon it.</p>

              <!-- Civic Section -->
              <section class="doctrine-section">
                  <h3>Civic Section — The Affirmation of Rank and Order</h3>

                  <h4>On the Reality of Rank</h4>
                  <p>The tribe confesses the law of rank as the cornerstone of all order. From the stars above to the roots beneath the earth, life is shaped by higher and lower. All things find their place not by chance, but by nature and worth. There is no equality in the created world. Rank is the condition for harmony. Without it, chaos reigns.</p>

                  <p>The tribe holds that hierarchy is not the invention of rulers, but the pattern impressed upon all things by Heaven. It is not resentment, but reverence, that is fitting before the difference between greater and lesser.</p>

                  <h4>On the Warrior and the Noble</h4>
                  <p>In every age, it is not the merchant, nor the peasant, nor the speaker of flattering words who preserves the life of the people, but the warrior. The tribe recognizes the warrior-aristocracy as the natural ruling element, not because it desires power, but because it has proven strength, courage, and mastery.</p>

                  <p>The noble is not he who seeks comfort, but he who accepts command as a burden. He does not beg for authority, he bears it. His law is not the whim of the hour, but loyalty to the unseen and eternal. He does not require the approval of the crowd, but stands as a pillar for the people.</p>

                  <h4>On Differentiation</h4>
                  <p>The tribe affirms that men differ in nature. Not all are called to lead, nor are all called to serve in the same way. This is not an injustice to be corrected, but the very structure of life. From the highest to the humblest, each has a part within the whole. When every man knows his station, the people live in harmony. When station is denied, disorder follows.</p>

                  <p>It is not ambition, but fulfillment, that the tribe teaches. The highest is called to lead, the strong to defend, the skilled to build, the faithful to serve. Each contributes according to his measure, and in doing so, the tribe becomes whole.</p>

                  <h4>On the Nobility of Obedience</h4>
                  <p>Obedience is not weakness. In an age that despises both authority and submission, the tribe remembers that true obedience is itself a noble act. The man who serves rightly, knowing his place and embracing it without envy, is more honored than the man who rebels in pride.</p>

                  <p>No shame belongs to the faithful man who keeps his station. He is the mortar between the stones. Without him, nothing stands.</p>

                  <h4>On the Rejection of Democracy</h4>
                  <p>The tribe rejects democracy as an affront to order and to nature itself. No people can be ruled by counting heads and chasing after popular favor. Truth is not subject to the will of the multitude. Authority does not descend from the masses, but from above.</p>

                  <p>The tribe will not subject itself to the chaos of elections, parties, and the endless quarrels of factions. The noble, the worthy, and the strong shall lead. The crowd shall follow. This is not oppression, but the natural order, and we rejoice to affirm it.</p>

        <section class="doctrine-section">
          <h3>Final Section — The Covenant and Destiny of Dixieland</h3>

          <h4>On the Covenant of the Tribe</h4>
          <p>The tribe is not gathered for convenience, nor for fleeting aims. Dixieland exists by covenant, not only among men but before God. We have been given blood, land, and law; we are bound to preserve them. This covenant is not a written contract, but a living bond, older than memory and deeper than any agreement.</p>

          <p>The tribe remembers that it is chosen for a work, not by merit, but by appointment. We are bound to keep faith with the ancestors who founded this land, with the generations yet to be born, and with the Most High who watches over nations. This covenant cannot be bought nor sold, nor dissolved for fear or favor.</p>

          <h4>On the Task of Restoration</h4>
          <p>The tribe does not look backward in idle nostalgia, but forward to a labor worthy of its strength. We are called not to mourn the loss of old things, but to restore what was shattered and to build anew on the old foundations.</p>

          <p>This age is an age of decay. Weakness is honored, the mob is crowned, and sacred things are mocked. The tribe will not follow this path. The tribe will overcome it. We will restore the rightful order, beginning with ourselves, our households, and our people.</p>

          <p>The tribe does not seek the approval of the world. Its task is not to please, but to conquer — not with sword alone, but with truth, courage, and unshakable faith.</p>

          <h4>On the Destiny of Dixieland</h4>
          <p>Dixieland is but one tribe among the Twelve, yet she is the first to remember, the first to rise, and the first to speak openly of what has been forgotten. We do not labor for ourselves alone. The greatness of Dixieland is not an end in itself, but the means by which the whole may be restored.</p>

          <p>We shall make America great by making Dixieland great. We will not waste our strength in idle quarrels, nor seek to reform that which is beyond repair. We will build, strengthen, and perfect our own house. And by our example, the other tribes shall remember. By our strength, the others shall find courage. By our endurance, the covenant of the Twelve shall be renewed.</p>

          <p>We shall preserve our blood, honor our ancestors, raise up new households, and restore the high things that have fallen. We shall stand even if all others fall. The world may rage and scoff, but Dixieland shall endure.</p>

          <p>So let it be written. So let it be done.</p>
