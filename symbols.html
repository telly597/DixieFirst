            <h2>Symbols of Dixieland</h2>

            <h3>Heraldic Emblem</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/lion_emblem.png" alt="Norman Lion Emblem" style="max-height:200px;">
            <p>The Lion of Rouen, drawn from Norman heraldry, stands as the emblem of Dixieland’s aristocratic and Christian foundations. It recalls Rollo, the Norse chieftain who became Count of Rouen and the founder of Normandy. From him descended the Norman knights who later conquered England and established a new warrior aristocracy. The Virginia Cavaliers, heirs of this lineage, carried across the sea not only blood, but the noble and martial spirit that shaped both Normandy, England, and Dixieland.</p>

            <h3>Flag</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/battle_flag.png" alt="Dixieland Flag" style="max-height:180px;">
            <p>The classic battle flag serves as the civil and military ensign of Dixieland. It is a symbol of struggle, endurance, and identity, rooted in the history of our people. It does not represent political theory but the blood and sacrifice of generations.</p>

            <h3>Motto</h3>
            <p>"Deo Vindice" — "God our Vindicator" — proclaims the divine sovereignty over our nation. It is not merely a memory of the past but a living declaration of who we are and whom we serve.</p>
