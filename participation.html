  <h3>Participation</h3>

  <p>To join the work of Dixieland is not to sign up for a program or register with an office. It is to take upon oneself the covenant and live it out, first in heart, then in word, and then in action. The tribe grows not by mass movements, but by the quiet gathering of the faithful.</p>

  <p>As part of the Twelve Nations Confederacy, the restoration begins where you stand. You are not alone, though you may begin alone. What is required is faith, memory, and resolve.</p>

  <h3>How to Begin</h3>

  <ol>
      <li>Read and internalize the <a href="doctrine.html">Doctrine of Dixieland</a>.</li>
      <li>Take the pledge, whether privately or with trusted kin.</li>
      <li>Form a small circle — no more than twelve — with those who share the covenant.</li>
      <li>Teach it, preserve it, and work quietly to gather others into remembrance.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The covenant spreads household to household, kin to kin, not by noise, but by fidelity. Let no one wait for permission or instruction to act. Every man and woman who knows the doctrine and bears the pledge is already counted among the living stones of Dixieland.</p>

  <h3>The Tribal Pledge</h3>

  <blockquote>
      <p>I pledge myself to Dixieland — to my tribe, to my blood, and to my God.</p>
      <p>I will bear the burden of command if called, obey with honor when placed below, and hold the covenant as sacred beyond all things.</p>
      <p>I shall stand without fear, endure without shame, and labor for the restoration of our people.</p>
      <p><strong>Hail Dixie.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
