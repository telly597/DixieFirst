  <h3>Participation</h3>

  <p>To join the work of Dixieland is not to sign up for a program or an institution. It is to take upon oneself the covenant and live it out, first in heart, then in word, and then in action. The tribe grows not by mass movements, but by the quiet gathering of the faithful.</p>

  <h3>How to Begin</h3>

  <ol>
      <li>Read and internalize the <a href="doctrine.html">Doctrine of Dixieland</a>.</li>
      <li>Take the pledge, whether privately or among trusted kin.</li>
      <li>Form a small circle, no more than twelve, with those who share in the covenant.</li>
      <li>Teach it, preserve it, and work quietly to gather others into remembrance.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The covenant spreads household to household, kin to kin, not by noise, but by fidelity. Let no one wait for permission or instruction to act. Every man and woman who knows the doctrine and bears the pledge is already counted among the living stones of Dixieland.</p>

  <h3>The Tribal Pledge</h3>

  <blockquote>
      <p>I pledge myself to Dixieland â€” to my tribe, to my blood, and to my God.</p>
      <p>I will bear the burden of command if called, obey with honor when placed below, and hold the covenant as sacred beyond all things.</p>
      <p>I shall stand without fear, endure without shame, and labor for the restoration of our people.</p>
      <p><strong>Hail Dixie.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
