        <!-- SECTION 1 -->
        <section class="doctrine-section">
            <h3>1. Create Your Mask</h3>
            <p>The first task of every tribesman is to create a War Mask — your anonymous digital identity. This identity is the face you will wear in all online spaces where the tribe operates. It is not simply a random alias; it is part of your craft. Without it, you have no shield, no banner, and no presence.</p>
            <p>A well-crafted War Mask protects you, lends you authority, and allows you to move freely across the digital terrain.</p>

            <h4>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h4>

            <p><strong>1.1. Create a New Anonymous Email</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not connect this email to any of your personal accounts.</li>
                <li>Do not use personal information, past usernames, or anything that can be traced to you.</li>
                <li>Write down the password securely offline.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>1.2. Create an X (Twitter) Account</strong></p>
            <p>This is your primary battleground.</p>
            <p>Choose a name and handle that reflect the tribe’s spirit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aim for something that feels like a Christian, Southern, or aristocratic identity.</li>
                <li>Example: @SouthernPillar, @RedRiverSquire, @CumberlandSon</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Profile Picture:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the tribe’s style: Dixie flag, a tribal shield, Christian symbol, historic photo, or meaningful symbol. Yes, it can be an anime girl so long as it's a Dixie-related edit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bio:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be simple, dignified, and subtle.</li>
                <li>Speak as a Southern Christian returning to the old ways.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>1.3. Create a Discord Account</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Required for initial screening and internal tribal use.</li>
                <li>Same as above: anonymous email.</li>
                <li>Avoid using microphones or cameras at all times.</li>
                <li>Do not join public political servers immediately with this account. Use only private links from trusted kin.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>1.4. Optional Secondary Platforms</strong></p>
            <p>These are useful but not mandatory.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Telegram: Useful for content sharing, group chats, and private channels.</li>
                <li>Instagram: For those who can handle visual and aesthetic content well.</li>
                <li>TikTok: For the bold who can engage in short-form video creation with skill and discretion.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 2 -->
        <section class="doctrine-section">
            <h3>2. Strengthen Your Foundation</h3>

            <p><strong>2.1. Read the Doctrine</strong></p>
            <p>Study the Dixieland Doctrine carefully. Absorb it. Understand the faith, the covenant, and the purpose.</p>

            <p><strong>2.2. Memorize the Motto</strong></p>
            <p><em>Deo Vindice (God our Vindicator)</em></p>
            <p>This is not a slogan. It is a confession.</p>

            <p><strong>2.3. Set Personal Rules</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>No personal posts. No modern irony. No excuses.</li>
                <li>Your War Mask exists to serve the tribe, not yourself.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2.4. Prepare Mentally</strong></p>
            <p>This work is not a hobby. It is duty. Take it as seriously as you would a real-world calling.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 3 -->
        <section class="doctrine-section">
            <h3>3. Screening Phase: Craft Basic Content Kits</h3>

            <p><strong>3.1. Five Original Dixie Memes</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create at least 5 memes aligned with the tribe's spirit.</li>
                <li>Southern identity</li>
                <li>Christian faith</li>
                <li>Aristocratic spirit</li>
                <li>Anti-modernity</li>
                <li>Humor</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3.2. Personal Confession (250 Words)</strong></p>
            <p>Write 250 words on why you believe in Dixieland.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not use AI.</li>
                <li>Grammar does not matter. Honesty does.</li>
                <li>Speak as a son of the South who remembers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 4 -->
        <section class="doctrine-section">
            <h3>4. Screening and Acceptance</h3>

            <p><strong>4.1. Enter the Gate</strong></p>
            <p>Join the private Discord, where screening is quietly and orderly conducted.</p>

            <p><strong>4.2. Present Your Kit</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Five Memes</li>
                <li>Personal Statement</li>
                <li>Proof of Kinship and Faith:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Submit a photo of your hand and a handwritten note with:</li>
                    <li>Your anonymous name.</li>
                    <li>The date and time.</li>
                    <li>The words: Hail Dixie.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>4.3. Await Brotherly Judgment</strong></p>
            <p>Your screening will be reviewed by existing Cells.</p>
            <p>You will receive either acceptance, asked to revise certain things, or quiet dismissal.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 5 -->
        <section class="doctrine-section">
            <h3>5. Assignment and Integration</h3>

            <p><strong>5.1. Assignment to a Cell</strong></p>
            <p>Upon acceptance, you will be placed into an existing Cell or used to form a new one.</p>
            <p>Each Cell is six men strong. If none are open, you will be held in reserve until enough men are gathered to form a fresh Cell.</p>
            <p>No Cell is randomly assembled. Cells are built for strength, balance, and trust.</p>

            <p><strong>5.2. Role Selection</strong></p>
            <p>Each Cell carries out its work through defined roles. You will be assigned one of the following based on your strengths, skills, and initiative.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Leader — Guides the Cell, gives direction, and keeps order.</li>
                <li>Memesmith — Creates graphics, memes, and propaganda.</li>
                <li>Video Specialist — Crafts videos suited for the platforms of battle.</li>
                <li>Reply Hound — Operates in replies, comment sections, and threads, guiding attention and shaping discussion.</li>
                <li>Scout — Quietly seeks out new talent, identifies opportunities, and monitors trends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may hold more than one function if needed. Your labor will be plain to all, and roles may change as trust grows.</p>

            <p><strong>5.3. Begin the Work</strong></p>
            <p>Once your role is set and your Cell formed, you will be given basic tasks and objectives.</p>
            <p>Cells operate independently but in harmony with the broader Tribe.</p>
            <p>Your task is simple: carry the spirit of Dixieland into the field, speak the language of your people, and lay stones for what is to come.</p>
            <p>You are now a brother among brothers. Take up your work.</p>
