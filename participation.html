            <h3>The Path of Participation</h3>
            <p>To join the work of Dixieland is not to enroll in an organization, nor to sign a ledger. It is to take upon oneself the covenant and live it out — first in heart, then in word, and finally in deed. The tribe is not gathered by programs or committees, but by faithful households who remember and act.</p>

            <p>The covenant is not simply a banner to stand under, but a cross to bear. It calls for an inner conquest, for the subordination of one's lower instincts to a higher law. Before you command others, you must first command yourself. The tribe is not built by numbers but by men who rule themselves and stand upright under Heaven.</p>

            <p>The restoration is not a political program, but a sacred work. The household is the temple; the hearth is the altar. The words of the covenant are not empty speech, but a consecration of life itself. Let every man guard his house as a sanctuary, where the covenant is remembered and lived.</p>

            <h3>How to Begin</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Read and fully internalize the <a href="doctrine.html">Doctrine of Dixieland</a>.</li>
                <li>Take the pledge, whether in solitude or among trusted kin.</li>
                <li>Order your own household. Let prayer, loyalty, and honor be restored first at home.</li>
                <li>Form a circle — no more than twelve — of those willing to share the covenant and its burdens.</li>
                <li>Teach it. Guard it. Pass it on. Let the work grow household to household, kin to kin.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Let no man wait for permission. No man needs sanction beyond the covenant itself. If you bear it in your heart, you are already counted among the living stones.</p>

            <h3>The Way Forward</h3>
            <p>From these small beginnings, the covenant spreads. It does not need mass movements or noisy demonstrations. What is needed is quiet fidelity. The strengthening of households. The gathering of small circles. The building of networks, not for spectacle, but for remembrance and action.</p>

            <p>Speak plainly. Work patiently. Remember always that you are not alone, for even now the Twelve Nations stir beneath the surface. By making Dixieland great, we help make the whole confederation great.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">Gather. Prepare. Remember.</p>

            <h3>Tribal Pledge of Dixieland</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I pledge myself to Dixieland — to my tribe, to my blood, and to my God.</p>
                <p>I will bear the burden of command if called, obey with honor when placed below, and hold the covenant as sacred beyond all things.</p>
                <p>I shall stand without fear, endure without shame, and labor for the restoration of our people.</p>
                <p><strong>Hail Dixie.</strong></p>
