            <h3>Organization</h3>
            <p>The tribe is structured into small, autonomous Cells. Each begins as a 6-man unit, acting as a clan or warband. Once strong and tested, it may grow to 12. Upon reaching 12, it divides into two fresh Cells of 6 each. This is the foundation of our operations.</p>

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>Each Cell works online. Its mission is the spread of our worldview. The fight is for the minds of men. The ground is social media, forums, content spaces, and every corner of the internet. The aim is to rally, teach, and inspire. The Cell is not passive. It moves. It speaks. It builds.</p>

            <h3>Discipline</h3>
            <p>There is no external authority. Discipline is internal. A Cell is held together by loyalty, kinship, and the covenant. Each man knows his role and keeps it. Orders are not barked but understood. No man waits to be told what he already knows to do.</p>

            <h3>Roles within the Cell</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leader:</strong> Guides the Cell. Keeps order and direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Deputy:</strong> Assists the leader. Acts in his stead if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificer:</strong> Handles the creation of visuals, graphics, and media.</li>
                <li><strong>Chronicler:</strong> Crafts words — texts, captions, statements, or videos.</li>
                <li><strong>Navigator:</strong> Scouts platforms, trends, and opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Messenger:</strong> Maintains discreet contact with other Cells and shares findings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>Operate under anonymity. Use alternate accounts. Protect your kin. Do not expose names, faces, or private lives. Prefer text, images, and pre-recorded audio over live calls. Work in the shadows, but with clarity and courage.</p>

            <h3>Growth</h3>
            <p>Cells seek worthy souls. Recruitment is quiet. Find those who share the heart and mind of the tribe. Do not grow for numbers alone. A weak link endangers all. Once 12 are gathered, split with dignity and purpose into two 6-man Cells.</p>

            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Cells are not businesses or clubs. They are kin-groups. Conduct yourself with respect, discipline, and seriousness. There is room for laughter, but none for disorder. Honor the covenant. Honor your word. Strengthen your brothers.</p>

            <h3>Fieldcraft</h3>
            <p>Act deliberately. Study platforms before speaking. Choose battles wisely. Stay sharp. Remain unseen when needed, yet strike clearly when the time is right. You are builders as much as warriors. Create. Teach. Leave the mark of the tribe wherever you pass.</p>

            <h3>The Long Work</h3>
            <p>There is no hurry. Our aim is not a flash in the pan, but the slow restoration of our people. Endure. Multiply. Outlast. The harvest is for those who remain when others fall away. Patience is the strength of the covenant.</p>
